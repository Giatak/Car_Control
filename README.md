# Car_Control

So basically by the name, the goal is that a windows computer to be connected with an Arduino by Serial Com
would tell the Arduino uno to run the specified motors and what not and then it works!

So if you can remote control the computer via wifi, then WOW you literally have a remote controled Car then

So I would only need 2 files 
slides.py - file for the computer to run on
arduino1.ino - file for the arduino to run on 

will this work? fk ik, but we'll see
